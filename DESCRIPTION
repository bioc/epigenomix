Description: A package for the integrative analysis of RNA-seq or
        microarray based gene transcription and histone modification
        data obtained by ChIP-seq. The package provides methods for
        data preprocessing and matching as well as methods for fitting
        bayesian mixture models in order to detect genes with
        differences in both data types.
