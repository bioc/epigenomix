Description: A package for the integrative analysis of RNA-seq or microarray based 
 gene transcription and histone modification data obtained by ChIP-seq. The package
 provides methods for data preprocessing and matching as well as methods
 for fitting bayesian mixture models in order to detect genes with
 differences in both data types.
